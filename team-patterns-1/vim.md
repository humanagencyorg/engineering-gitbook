# VIM

VIM allows us to effectively work together in remote pair programming sessions.  Using VIM, we are able to SSH into each other's machines and work on the same code and same terminal.

By standardizing on an optimized VIM config, we're able to work quickly and effectively.&#x20;

Take a look at our [VIM setup](https://github.com/humanagencyorg/vim-config) to get started.
