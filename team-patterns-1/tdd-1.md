# TDD

Here's why our team loves TDD:

* **Fast feedback == Flow** -There is a zen like flow to efficient TDD.  When you don't have to break your concentration to manually click through your webapp, your mind is able to stay more focused on the code itself.
* **Systemetized simplicity - ** The rules of TDD encourage you to get to green bar as quickly as possible and subsequently refactor.  Because each step takes the simplest path, your overall solution will be the simplest solution.
* **Intentional Interfaces **- When you actually write your test before you write any code, you are forced to think through all of your inputs, your outputs, and very intentionally define your ideal interface.
* **Code Barometer** - When you are using TDD, your tests become a barometer for code cleanliness and technical debt.  If your tests begin becoming difficult to write, it is usually a sign that your class is doing too much or your domain could be simpler.
* **Easier to fix issues** - Have you ever written fixed a bug, ran the specs, and handed it to QA without even opening the app?  When you have great tests, it is easier to reproduce and fix issues just using tests than attempting to manually recreate the issue in the UI.
*   **Safety Net - **This is an obvious one.  When we upgrade gems or refactor code, our team can merge those changes as soon as they have a green build.  We only have to QA changes to user functionality.
