## Make it Easy to Understand What Changed

### Provide a clear description on your PR

Create a checklist on the PR description that lines changes in functionality or major refactors.

Keep your PR focused on your description.  Consider breaking out a major refactor into a new PR.

### Leave comments in on your PR before sharing for Code Review

If you have a piece of code that you are not sure about, leave a comment in your PR.  It calls attention to the line of code and provides an opportunity for feedback from others. &#x20;

### PR naming

1. Include the ID of your story.  `ha-12840`
2. Provide a short description of the branch with words separated by dashes `ha-12840-add-plans`
3. If you have to branch from a feature branch, use underscores to denote the change.  `ha-12840-add-plans_admin`.
