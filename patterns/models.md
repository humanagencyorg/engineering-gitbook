Models primarily provide an interface to persist data to the database by extending `ActiveRecord`.

Of course, there are many [objections to mixing](https://blog.sapiensworks.com/post/2012/04/07/Just-Stop-It!-The-Domain-Model-Is-Not-The-Persistence-Model.aspx) the domain and persistence layers.  Generally, the best path is to do what is easiest and create the abstractions as they are needed.
